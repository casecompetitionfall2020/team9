# Our idea of Sustainable Travels

Give to travellers the possibility to have fun travelling and at the same time to do something good for the environment: the more you travel, the more you volunteering to accomplish some "green" initiative (ex: cleaning beaches from plastic in Thailand, etc..), the more you are rewarded with points.
Once customer take part to green activities he/she earns some points that can be rewarded to pay for local activities (like kayak, dinner..). 
Travellers can also invite friends to join the initiatives and earn more points when them partecipate for volunteering too.
