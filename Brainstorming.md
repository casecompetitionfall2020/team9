# Initial Brainstorming - Initial ideas


- COVID insights: as a consequence to the pandemic people are travelling lower distance tipically in their country. What can be done in this way to enhance the local experience?
 
- RESPONSIBLE tourism: what can be done in travel in terms of transportation means? Can travel promote the use of green transportation like Bike rental, Uber …? And how?
 
- RESPONSIBLE traveller: what about rewarding a good customer ? Eg: when staying to an hotels the customer who decides to keep towels for some days without washing them can receive some points to reuse maybe in local activity during his stay ?
 
- Can travel be funny and responsible at the same time? Can we encourage people to travel somewhere and take part to some cleaning initiatives (like removing plastic from beaches, etc..)
 
- Is there a way to provide a more unique “local” experience to travellers? There are some website like https://www.withlocals.com/ , (maybe in TripAdvisor too ?) which provides local guides, dinners and activities to tourists with the advantage of putting in communication local people with travellers, but still they are not worldwide. In my personal experience there aren’t many web resources on this (I found more useful contacts or phone numbers on travel book like Lonely Planet…) , moreover the advantage I see on this is that there are really some remote places in the world hard to reach that only locals may show to tourists..
