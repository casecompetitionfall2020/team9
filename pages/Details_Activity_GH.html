    <p class="title-ghana">Teaching in community schools with limited resources provides an engaging environment for educating children and teenagers. Your ideas, your energy, and your presence are exciting for students and invigorating for the teachers and parents. The students are full of curiosity about the world around them and they welcome your perspective, you will also serve or be seen as a positive role models to students, You will be place in one of our community schools where you can choose to teach a class on your own or assist a local teacher till you are confident or ready to teach solo.
         You can choose to teach pre-schools (age 1 to 6-years), primary (age 7 to 11), junior high or senior high school. You may also be involved in creative projects and non-classroom based activities which help create a stimulating learning environment. All our community schools are very understaffed this is a common phenomenon in both rural and urban areas of Ghana, hence the need to recruit and place volunteers in communities where there are simply insufficient teachers to cater for the number of children.
         You will be effectively placed in rural communities where you will teach solo and assist the few teachers available to teach basic causes like English, Mathematics, Science, French, Spanish, creative art, drama, music, and Computer science  from per-schools(1-year to 6-year), primary(7-year to 12-years), junior high or senior high schools.
